# World_Weather_Analysis

# Overview
This Analysis folder looks at different weather patterns ariund the globe and help travelers who want to book a trip based on weather description, maximun temperature, minimun temperature and other weather factors.

## Background

>A recommendation was made to add the weather description to the weather data retrieved in World_Weather_Analysis module. Then, use input statements to filter the data based on the Beta testers input for weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

### Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
1. Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes.
2. Retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap.
3. Retrieve the current weather description for each city from the API call.
4. Create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

The DataFrame created by an API call with OpenWeatherMap consist of over 700 cities around the globe and:

* Maximum Temperature
* Cloudiness
* Wind Speed
* Humidity
* Current Weather Description

### Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
1. Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences.
2. Use customer weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.
3. Print those destinations on amrker layer map with pop-up markers.

Using the weather database and Google Maps API a map was plottled with different travel destinations with a hotel at each location.For example, the figure belwo shows the locations of all the places in the weather database that have a maximun temperature of 90F and minimun temperature of 75F.

### Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
1. Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations.
2. Create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.

For example, the image below shows a four stop itinerary in Northern Brazil:

Adding a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city with espesifics, such as Hotel Name, City, Country, Weather Description and Max temp.
